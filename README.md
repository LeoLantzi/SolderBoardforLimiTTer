# SolderBoardforLimiTTer
Ideas to solder LimiTTer componets on a pcb board instead of wiring, to make it simpler and save space.

worked for me, but put the charger bit outside not like intended.
The +3.3V pin  for the Sparkfun  usb lipo charger needs extra care in insulating to the arduino BLK pin, or scrap it off of and use an wire.
If I ever make an revision: As the first BM019pin is not used, cut it off. And make a small cutout on the board  and place usb port of the lipo charge .


made +20 if anybody wants them, message me
